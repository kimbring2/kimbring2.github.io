# Jetbot 
Recently, the Jetson Nano board released by Nvidia is announced, and robots using this and the robot operating system is putting on the market. One of them is a kind of line tracer robot that uses a camera. You can purchase one at Amazon([Amazon  Jetbot Purchasing Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WMZ3KLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

Also, ROS code for Jetbot is also released together, so it can be easily installed and tested.

# Soccer game using Jetbot
First of all, the reason I bought Jetbot is to try to implement robot soccer using Gazebo and Deep Learning.

Gazebo reduces the inconvenience of having to test a robot in a real environment by controlling the robot designed for ROS in a simulated environment. And Deep Learning technology makes robots play games more like people. My goal in this project is to combine these two benefits so that the Jetbot robot can play the Soccer game.
