# Introduction
There are currently various attempts to apply Deep Reinforcement to actual robot. The characteristics of Reinforcment Learning require over hundred of the initialization of the environment and many data for Deep Learning making it impossible to train the robot in the actual environment.

To overcome these difficulties, people first create a simulation that looks exactly like the real world. In this simulation, training is advanced for the virtual robot. Since then, many researches try to use the tranined model for an actual robot.

In this post, I'll try to know that these methods are actually working. The test uses a robot called Jetbot that has a GPUon its main board. And the environment is a soccer that is familiar to many people.

Code for that post can be found on the Github [Jetbot Soccer Github](https://github.com/kimbring2/jetbot_soccer).

All the products used in the tests are inexpensive and can be purchased in Amazon. Thus, you can easily try to reproduce them.

# What is Jetbot?
Recently, the Jetson Nano board is released by NVIDIA. And various robots that using that board is selling on the market. One of them is Jetbot that is a kind of line tracer robot. I purchased it at [Amazon Jetbot Purchasing Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WMZ3KLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 
Designing a customizing robot is a difficult and time-consuming task. Thus, I choose a Jetbot. 

<img src="/assets/NVIDIA-Jetbot.jpg" width="800">

Furthermore, ROS nodes and Gazebo model of Jetbot is released together. Thus, it became easier to install and running. 

[![Jetbot ROS test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cLF34VXZjp4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cLF34VXZjp4 "Jetbot Running ROS - Click to Watch!")

I install ROS on the purchased jetbot and test the basic operation. Installation ROS is very easy and Jupyter Notebook work environment is also easy. 

However, the 18650 battery of 65mm length and 2600mAH capacity installed on Jetbot can not be purchased in Korea local shop. That's why I try to buy from an overseas online shop. It looks difficult importing battery from another country because of customs clearance. Thus, I can not test the Jetbot using the battery.

<a name="soccer_game_jetbot"></a>
# Soccer game using Jetbot
First of all, I plan to use a Jetbot for playing soccer. I can use a Gazebo of ROS, Deep Learning for this project.  

<img src="/assets/soccer_jetbot.jpg" width="800">

Gazebo reduces a inconvenience of having to test a robot in a real environment by simulating robot in virtual environment. And Deep Learning technology can make agent play soccer like a human. My goal in this project is combining these two skill for Jetbot playing a soccer like a real human.

<a name="jetbot_urdf"></a>
# URDF file for Jetbot
The URDF file is a format that describes the appearance, physical characteristics, mounting sensor, etc of a ROS robot. Also, to simulate a robot with Gazebo, that file is needed first .

There is also another format called SDF file that is a more general than URDF. But, that format does not support the simulation in Gazebo yet. Thus, it is unavoidable to change SDF file of Jetbot to URDF format. Usaually, Gazebo does not use URDF files directly. It uses a similar format called XACRO that is very similar to URDF. Changing format from URDF to SDF is very easy. 

File must also contain information about characteristics of sensor such as camera for Gazebo simulation. This is created separately in a file with Gazebo extension and loaded from Xacro file. It makes a XACRO file is not too complicated.

You can download model file of Jetbot at [Jetbot URDF file link](https://github.com/kimbring2/jetbot_gazebo/tree/master/jetbot/jetbot_description/urdf).

<a name="jetbot_rviz"></a>
# Simulating Jetbot at Rviz
After creating the URDF file, you can verify it in ROS Rviz. If there is a joing part that can move like a wheel, you can use the GUI to move it in Rviz.

<img src="/assets/Rviz_Jetbot.gif" width="800">

<a name="jetbot_gazebo"></a>
# Simulating Jetbot at Gazebo
Unlike RviZ, Gazebo work with the physical elements of the actual robot and the surrounding environment. Thus, you can get the same effect as testing the robot in the actual environment.

<img src="/assets/Gazebo_Jetbot.gif" width="800">

<a name="soccer_object_gazebo"></a>
# Install soccer object at Gazebo
A Jetbot model was created and tested using Rviz and Gazebo. Now you can add soccer fields, goals, and soccer balls around the robot and control the robot by applying torque to each wheel. That kind of testing method is provided in Gazabo without making additional code.

As you can see in the video, the physical conditions of Gazebo are similar to the actual conditions. Thus, it is not easy to control the robot than pure simulated environmnet.

<a name="gazebo_python"></a>
# Connect Gazebo and Python
The jetbot will receive the camera and other sensor information as input and will use it to adjust the speed of the left and right wheels to play soccer. For this, we need Python code that performs the above steps. ROS can input and output these data using a package called rospy.

As you can see in the video above, you can use Python code to output the camera sensor image and adjust the speed of the left and right wheels.

<a name="object_location"></a>
# Get object location in Python
The most important goal in soccer will be to put a soccer ball into the opponent's goal. To do this, we should know the location of the soccer ball and goal in real time.

```
football_pose: 
position: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.119999999992
  
left_goal_pose: 
position: 
  x: -9.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.01
  
right_goal_pose: 
position: 
  x: 9.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.01
```

If you know the position of each object in the above way, we could use a method that gives a score when it is close to the soccer ball goal or reset a field.

```
# maybe do some 'wait for service' here
reset_simulation = rospy.ServiceProxy('/gazebo/reset_simulation', Empty)
def state_callback(msg):
    # print("msg.name: " + str(msg.name))
    # msg.name: ['ground_plane', 'field', 'left_goal', 'right_goal', 'football', 'jetbot']

    football_index = (msg.name).index("football")
    left_goal_index = (msg.name).index("left_goal")
    right_goal_index = (msg.name).index("right_goal")
    #print("football_index: " + str(football_index))

    football_pose = (msg.pose)[football_index]
    #print("football_pose.position.x: " + str(football_pose.position.x))

    football_pose_x = football_pose.position.x
    print("football_pose_x: " + str(football_pose_x))

    if (football_pose_x > 5):
        reset_simulation()

    left_goal_pose = (msg.pose)[left_goal_index]
    #print("left_goal_pose: " + str(left_goal_pose))

    right_goal_pose = (msg.pose)[right_goal_index]
    #print("right_goal_pose: " + str(right_goal_pose))

    global x
    global y
    global theta

    x = msg.pose[1].position.x
    y = msg.pose[1].position.y
    rot_q = msg.pose[1].orientation
    (roll, pitch, theta) = euler_from_quaternion([rot_q.x, rot_q.y, rot_q.z, rot_q.w])
```

The above code is part of https://github.com/kimbring2/jetbot_soccer/blob/master/jetbot/jetbot_control/src/main.py. After running Gazebo and controller, give a control signal to move the soccer ball using Jetbot. After that, when the soccer ball goal is reached, the simulation is initialized.

<a name="multi_jetbot"></a>
# Place multiple Jetbot in field
For the simplest soccer game, Jetbot that kicks a soccer ball and Jetbot that prevents it are placed in the field, and an environment is established that can get the image of the camera sensor and control wheel speed of each robot.

[![Jetbot soccer test3](https://img.youtube.com/vi/G6HAJRmqrBs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/G6HAJRmqrBs "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")

As described above, two Jetbots are placed in the field, one jetbot tries to make a goal, and one jetbot tries to defend the goal. In the case of multiplt agent such as that case, the Self-play Reinforcement Learning looks good for using.

<a name="physical_parameter"></a>
# Physical parameter of Jetbot
A Jetbot consists of a chassis and two wheels connected to it. In order to simulate a real environment with Gazebo, these physical parameters are set in the same way as in the actual case. Since Jetbot's exact gazebo physics parameters is not asked now, I temporarily use the parameters of existing robots called [iRobot Gazebo Repository](https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/irobotcreate2ros).

```
<gazebo reference="chassis">
  <mu1>0.0</mu1>
  <mu2>0.0</mu2>
  <slip1>1.0</slip1>
  <slip2>1.0</slip2>
  <kp>10000000</kp>
  <kd>1</kd>
  <fdir1>1 0 0</fdir1>
  <minDepth>0.0001</minDepth>
  <maxContacts>1</maxContacts>
</gazebo>
 
 <gazebo reference="left_wheel">

```

In previous tests, the proper physical parameters are not found, and the Jetbot moved abnormally slowly. However, after applying the appropriate parameters, the robot is able to confirm the movement similar to the actual situation.

<a name="jebot_soccer_ball"></a>
# Soccer ball detection
To play soccer, Jetbot must first find a soccer ball. Jetbot do it using the camera sensor and object detection Deep Learning library.

```
import cvlib as cv

bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(cv_image, confidence=0.05)
for obj in label:
   if obj == "sports ball":
       index = label.index(obj)
       x1 = int(bbox[index][0])
       y1 = int(bbox[index][1])
       x2 = int(bbox[index][2])
       y2 = int(bbox[index][3])
       cv2.rectangle(cv_image, (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (0,255,0), 2)
```

<img src="/assets/Jetbot_Soccer_5.gif" width="800">

The Jetbot camera sensor currently in use is a fixed type. Thus, there is a problem that it is not recognized when the soccer ball is too close. However, it is correctly recognized when the entire soccer ball is on the screen.

<a name="jebot_soccer_field"></a>
# Customize soccer field for Jetbot
In the case of Jetbot, unlike other soccer-only robots, there is no arm to fix the soccer ball. Therefore, there are restrictions on various actions. So I devise a way to set up walls on all sides.

<img src="/assets/Jetbot_Soccer_Field.png" width="800">

Creating a wall in this way will prevent the soccer ball from leaving too far from robot, even if Jetbot doesn't hole the soccer ball.

<a name="jebot_action"></a>
# Convert continuous action to discrete
The most basic action of Jetbot is the speed of both wheels. However, since this speed value is a continuos value, the range is too wide for direct use. Thus, I combine this value and turned it into the six most used actions in soccer.

```
stop_action = [0, 0]
forward_action = [40, 40]
left_action = [40, -40]
right_action = [-40, 40]
bacward_action = [-40, -40]
kick_action = [100, 100]
robot_action_list = [stop_action, forward_action, left_action, right_action, bacward_action, kick_action]
```

Then, I select the generated discrete type action as random and confirm the action of Jetbot.

```
robot1_action_index = random.randint(0,5)
robot2_action_index = random.randint(0,5)
robot1_action = robot_action_list[robot1_action_index]
robot2_action = robot_action_list[robot2_action_index]
    
pub_vel_left_1.publish(robot1_action[0])
pub_vel_right_1.publish(robot1_action[1])

pub_vel_left_2.publish(robot2_action[0])
pub_vel_right_2.publish(robot2_action[1])
```

<img src="/assets/Jetbot_Soccer_6.gif" width="800">

Now that everything is ready, we can use Deep Reinforcement Learning for Jetbot playing soccer.

<a name="jetbot_rl"></a>
# Reinforcement Learning of Jetbot
For Reinforcement Learning, network input and output are required. In the case of Jetbot, the input is an image obtained by changing the size of the image taken by the camera to 84x84x3. And the output is an action consisting of a ball kick, stopping, moving forward, moving backward, turning left, turning right.

<img src="/assets/Jetbot_RL_Network.png">

Moreover, it is necessary to define a reward for the training of Reinforcement Learning. At the very beginning, the camera is set to give a reward value of 1 when a soccer ball is detected by the camera.

```
r = 0
for obj in label:
    if obj == "sports ball":
        r = 1
        index = label.index(obj)
```

In the initial stage of Reinforcement Learning, training data is collected while performing random actions so that the agent can experience various situation. This part is for exploration of Reinforcement Learning.

After trarning, we can compare the behavior of Jetbot with the previous behavior to check Reinforcement Learning is effective.

<a name="jetbot_real_soccer"></a>
# Set real soccer environment
After Jetbot can play soccer using Reinforcement Learning in Gazebo. We should transfer the trained model to a real Jetbot and make sure it works well in a real environment.

<img src="/assets/soccer_set.png" width="800">

First, I pick an appropriate goal and a soccer ball on Amazon [Soccer post and ball Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VDN239T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The shape of the simulation are a little different from these things. Thus, shapd of goal and goal post in simulation should be changed. Also, I select green soccer field rug for floor [Soccer field rug Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q122XQ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

<a name="location_change"></a>
# Object location change in Python
When performing Reinforcement Learning, position changed of soccer ball when episode is initialized is needed to confirm traning is done correct. In Gazebo, we can change the position of an object in the world using “/ gazebo / set_model_state” topic.

```
from gazebo_msgs.msg import ModelState

set_state = rospy.ServiceProxy('/gazebo/set_model_state', SetModelState)
pose = Pose() 
pose.position.x = np.random.randint(0,6)
pose.position.y = np.random.randint(0,6)
pose.position.z = 0.12
  
pose.orientation.x = 0
pose.orientation.y = 0
pose.orientation.z = 0
pose.orientation.w = 0
    
state_model = ModelState()   
state_model.model_name = "football"
state_model.pose = pose
resp = set_state(state_model)
```

When one episode is completed, the initialization position of the Jetbot is fixed. However, the position of the soccer ball can be changed every time as can be seen in the video, 

<img src="/assets/Jetbot_Soccer_7.gif" width="800">

When Reinforcement Learning works normally, after setting as above, Jetbot must see the direction where the soccer ball is located after a certain episode.

# Jetbot Reinforcement Learning Result
I observe the behavior of Jetbot after Reinforcement Learning as a condition to receive a reward of 1 when soccer ball is detected.

[![Jetbot Reinforcement Learning test1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bbSEE9zK8a4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bbSEE9zK8a4 "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")
<strong>Click to Watch!</strong>

Looking at the video, I am able to confirm that there is a case where the total sum of reward do not increase even though the behavior of Jetbot is like finding a soccer ball.

<img src="/assets/soccer_ball_range.png" width="800">

Thus, I reconfirm the part that detects the soccer ball. The minimum distance for detection is confirmed around 1.3m. I think the reason of that problem is angle of Jetbot's camera which is slightly facing the floor not straight ahead.
