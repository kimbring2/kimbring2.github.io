# Jetbot 
Recently, the Jetson Nano board released by Nvidia is announced, and robots using this and the robot operating system is putting on the market. One of them is a kind of line tracer robot that uses a camera. You can purchase one at Amazon([Amazon Jetbot Purchasing Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WMZ3KLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

Also, ROS code for Jetbot is also released together, so it can be easily installed and tested.

# Soccer game using Jetbot
First of all, the reason I bought Jetbot is to try to implement robot soccer using Gazebo and Deep Learning.

Gazebo reduces the inconvenience of having to test a robot in a real environment by controlling the robot designed for ROS in a simulated environment. And Deep Learning technology makes robots play games more like people. My goal in this project is to combine these two benefits so that the Jetbot robot can play the Soccer game.

# Making a URDF file for Jetbot
The URDF file is a format that describes the appearance, physical characteristics, mounting sensor, etc. of a ROS robot. Also, to simulate a robot with Gazebo, the file must be present.

There is information called SDF file that is a more improved format than URDF, but it is understood that the format does not yet support the simulation in Gazebo, so it is unavoidable to change SDF file to URDF.

Also, the Gazebo tutorial does not use URDF files immediately, but uses a similar format called XACRO. It was almost similar to URDF, and the format could be changed without major changes.

The file must also contain information on the camera sensor characteristics for Gazebo simulation. This is created separately in a file with gazebo extension and loaded from Xacro file so that the file is not too complicated.

That way, you can check the final file at [Jetbot URDF file link](https://github.com/kimbring2/jetbot_gazebo/tree/master/jetbot/jetbot_description/urdf).
