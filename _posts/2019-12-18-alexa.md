# Project Introduction
After knowing I can install Alexa of Amazon in Raspberry Pi, I purchase some material for that and test function of voice service.

And I think it would be nice to use Philips Hue, which can be controlled remotely, and control it with alexa.

Furthermore, I can even listen Audible by voice command of Alexa.

If many functions can be controlled by voice, it is expected that a smart home with a considerable level can be created.

In my case, I am able to install it without any major problems. But if I do not connect the microphone, it wouldn't run properly, so when testing, be sure to enable and use the microphone.
