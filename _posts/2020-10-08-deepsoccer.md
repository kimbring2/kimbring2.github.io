# Introduction
There are currently various attempts to apply Deep Reinforcement to actual robot. The characteristics of Reinforcment Learning require over hundred of the initialization of the environment and many data for Deep Learning making it impossible to train the robot in the actual environment.

To overcome these difficulties, people first create a simulation that looks exactly like the real world. In this simulation, training is advanced for the virtual robot. Since then, many researches try to use the tranined model for an actual robot.

In this post, I'll try to confirm these methods are actually working. The test uses a robot called Jetbot that has a GPU on its main board. And the environment is a soccer that is familiar to many people.

Code for that post can be found on the [DeepSoccer Github](https://github.com/kimbring2/DeepSoccer).

All the products used in the tests are inexpensive and can be purchased in Amazon. Thus, you can easily try to reproduce them.

# Robot design
I conclude that no matter how much football fields I changed, Jetbot need to take a soccer ball or kick it. Thus, I decided to design a robot exclusively for soccer and using the Jetson Nano.

Fortunately, 3d model of NVIDIA Kaya robots and robot participating in Robocup are available online. By using both of these as a reference and utilizing 3d printer, I can easily create a Jetbot for football. And recently, the price of 3D printers has dropped sharply. Thus, I manage to find one printer to create a soccer robot at a very affordable price.

1. [Kaya robot model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/03aa2560e7a40b2b7da40e12/w/001dbb6db63b0092c9ea5823/e/37043abce9062fab02c40889)
2. [Robocup robot model](https://www.stlfinder.com/model/naghshe-jahan-2010-robocup-soccer-robot/2284603/)
3. [3D printer](https://ko.aliexpress.com/item/32829861835.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.42964c4dsLAMTk)

Jetbot's soccer robot design has two primary focuses. Kaya robot's motors, screws, batteries, electronics, etc., initially offered by NVIDIA, are the latest parts sold today and should be used wherever possible. Second, the overall design of the robot should be as similar as possible to the design of the robot that entered Robotbup.

To achieve such a goal, two robot parts are once separated and measured to confirm what parts are needed to be newly designed or modified.

The new robot will have a solenoid in the center for a kicking and the required parts will be produced using a 3D printer.

<a name="wheel"></a>
## Wheel
The power supply to the dynamixel is 12V, which utilizes the Jetbot of WaveShares main board which has 3 18560 battery.

<img src="/assets/circuit_design_soccer.png" width="800">

The U2D2 board and U2D2 power hub can be purchased at the Robotis shopping mall. However, if you have existing one, you can change only the 12V power supply method and use the rest as it is.

1. [U2D2](http://www.robotis.us/u2d2/)
2. [U2D2 Power Hub](http://www.robotis.us/u2d2-power-hub-board-set/)

It is judged that the size omniwheel is too large. Thus, I decided to replace it with a slightly smaller wheel. Basically, onmiwheel product which provides a 3D model is selected for using in Gazebo simualtion.

ID and communication method and firmware version of of Dynamixel can given via a program provided by ROBOTIS. I test a motor seperately before installing it to robot body. A power supply and TTL communication can be done by using a U2D2 board and power hub.

<img src="/assets/assembly_1.jpg" height="400"> <img src="/assets/assembly_2.jpg" height="400">

After confirming only the operation of the motor separately, the motor and the control, power board are combined to the robot body. 

<img src="/assets/ccw_setting.png" width="400"> <img src="/assets/speed_setting.png" width="400">

In the case of dynamixel, the initial mode is the joint mode. Mode is needed to be changed to the wheel mode for using soccer robot. This can be achieved by setting the CCW Angle Limit of motor to 0. To rotate the motor set in the wheel mode at a specific speed, you just need to give a specific value to Moving Speed.

Next, I test adjusting the speed of dynamixel using rostopic, as in the previous Jetbot.

The Jetbot Soccer version uses an omniwheel that has a many sub wheel. In order to properly simulate this with Gazebo, we must make sure that each sub wheel rotates correctly. First, I check it using RViz in the same way as a main wheel.

[![Omniwheel RVIz test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Oa-rRioxU7M/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Oa-rRioxU7M "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")

After completing the test with RVIz, the test is similarly performed with Gazebo. It is confirmed that when the friction with the floor is large, the phenomenon that the sub wheel do not rotate properly is occurred. Finding the optimal friction parameters will be an important task.

<a name="solenoid"></a>
## Solenoid
The mechanism for controlling the ball is composed of a rubber roller for fixing and a solenoid electromagnet for kicking.

1. [Engraving rubber roller(Made in Korea)](
https://www.ebay.com/itm/50mm-Engraving-Rubber-Roller-Brayer-Stamping-Printing-Screening-Tool-Korea-/153413802463)

For the part for grabiing the soccer ball, I use a part of engraving roller. The core of the roller is made by 3D printer and connected to a DC motor which is included in origin Jetbot.

[![Roller test 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/u3jQLBPoC7Q/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/u3jQLBPoC7Q "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")

After completing the operation test with the roller alone, it is mounted on the of the robot second body layer. Since then, I test whether robot can actually hold the ball.

[![Roller test 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ve6R_gJHDgg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ve6R_gJHDgg "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")

For the part for kicking the soccer ball, I use a solenoid electromagnet. To control the solenoid electromagnet in the ROS, we should control GPIO using code. I use a GPIO library of Jetson (https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio) provided by NVIDIA.

It is determined that directly connecting the solenoid motor directly to the 12V power supply can not enough force to kick the ball far. Thus, large capacity capacitor and charging circuit for it is added. Thankfully I could find circuit and component for this at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17twkN9F0Dghrc06b_U9Iviq9Si9rsyOG/view.

After a 250v 1000uf capacitor and a Â±45V-390V capacitor charger are added, a solenoid can push a heavy a billiard ball to considerable distance.

Because the wheel and roller part have all simple structure, they can be implemented using the default controller of Gazebo. However. the solenoid part need a custom controller since it has spring part. You can find a official tutorial for that at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_i5&cat=. 

<img src="/assets/Spring-Constant.jpg" width="600">

```
namespace gazebo
{
	class SolenoidElectromagnetSpringPlugin : public ModelPlugin
	{
		public: SolenoidElectromagnetSpringPlugin() {}     
...
...
...

public: void OnRosMsg(const std_msgs::Float32ConstPtr &_msg)
{
	std::cout << "_msg->data: " << _msg->data << std::endl;
		 
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	    this->joint->SetForce(0, 1000 * float(_msg->data));
}

protected: void OnUpdate()
{
	double current_angle = this->joint->Position(0);
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
		this->joint->SetForce(0, (this->kx * (this->setPoint - current_angle)));
}
```

After testing the tutorial plugin first, add OnRosMsg, OnUpdate function to ModelPlugin. The OnRosMsg function is for receiving message transmitted to rostopic which include force applied to the solenoid by battery. The OnUpdate function is a part for defining a force applied by the spring.

```
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="stick_solenoid_electromagnet_joint_spring" filename="libsolenoid_electromagnet_joint_spring_plugin.so">
    <kx>1000</kx>
    <set_point>0.01</set_point>
    <joint>stick</joint>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>
```

Adding the above part to jetbot_soccer.gazebo after defining the plugin can make it possible to use a custom pluging in that joint.

<a name="lidar"></a>
## Soccer robot design(Lidar)
Soccer robot need to check a obstacle of front side. Using only camera sensor is not enough for that. Thus, I decide adding lidar sensor.

<img src="/assets/lidar_circuit.png" width="800">

The lidar sensor I use can measure only on the front side. It requires 5V, GND and UART GPIO pins of Jetson Nano.

After checking operation of lidar sensor at simulation. I also check real lidar sensor can measure distance of front obstacle.

<a name="infrared"></a>
## Soccer robot design(Infrared)
Robot need know it is holding holding ball now because camera can not see a lower part of robot. In order to solve these problems, I decide to add an infrared obstacle detection sensor at side of the roller that holds the ball.

<img src="/assets/infrared_circuit.png" width="450">

The infrared sensor uses GPOI as an input directuib, as opposed to the solenoid, which used GPIO as an output. If an obstacle is detected, the sensor gives a different signal to Jetson Nano.

[![Infrared test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ilSl8ReIZsA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ilSl8ReIZsA "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")
<strong>Click to Watch!</strong>

After mounting the infrared sensor in real robot, I also confirm that the same operation can be performed in infrared sensor of Gazebo simulation.

<a name="teleoperation"></a>
## Soccer robot design(Teleoperation)
It makes sense that the default motions performed in Gazebo simulations can be done in a real robot also. In order to confirm tat, the motion control function of  original version of Jetbot using the gamepad is slightly modified for Jetbot soccer version.

<img src="/assets/teleoperation_1.png" width="600">

You probably remember the gamepad UI that is in orginal teleoperation.ipynb file. Only 0, 1 scroolbal is used for controlling the left and right wheel in that file. In my case, I set it as above for controlling roller, stick, omniwheel.

back_link = traitlets.dlink((controller.buttons[3], 'value'), (omniwheel_back, 'value'), transform=lambda x: -x)
```

Like the original method, using the gamepad requires combining Traitlets package of python and control code of hardware. Above code is a sample for I use for omniwheel control. First, Dynamixel SDK is used for creating function that gives direction and speed to each omniwheel, and then use these function to create function for the robot to move forward, turn left, turn right, reverse, and stop. Then, using this function, a configurable class of traitlets is created, and the class declared at the end is connected to the gamepad UI using the dlink function of Traitlets.

As you can see in the video, you can see the basic movement and ball dribbling are working well. However, kicking power is weak. It is considered that  voltage , current are insufficient because battery and solenoid are directly connected. To solve these problem, I decide to use the method of collecting the high voltage using a large capacitor and then releasing it to the solenoid at once.

I test again basic soccer function after adding a large capacitor. It seems like that the kick function is reinforced and it can kick a balls to a long distance than before.
