# Blog Introduction
I am a researcher interested in making agent acts like a humans by using Deep Learning. There are various field in that, I mainly studying a Reinforcment Learning.

# Why I began to be interested in this
Before I got into Deep Running, I found one project about Deep Reinforcement Learning for playing Mario game. I trained it during one day. At that time, I was really surprised to see agent can finish one stage like a human.

After then, I began to study Reinforcement Learning for knowing deepy about it.

# Certification Infomation
For improving my knowledge Deep Learning, I taken Deep Learning Nanodegree course which was the best lecture in my life.

Futhermore, I have the following Deep Learning related cerification:
