# Blog Introduction
I am a researcher interested in making agents more like humans, mainly using Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 
Even though I know that Deep Learning allows for a large number and there are many different fields, the blog will mainly raise Reinforcment Learning.

# Why I began to be interested in this
Before I got into deep running, I accidentally used a neural network to download the code to play Mario, and trained it during the day. I didn't know much about Deep Learning, so I was surprised to see how agent played the whole stage like a person.

Knowing that the code that played Mario is primarily based on Reinforcement learning and the Neural Network, I began to study that area.

# Degree information

Since there was a limit to learning alone, I was proceeding with Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree course and was able to graduate safely. This lecture was the best lecture I had heard, so I am very excited that I have completed the whole process.

However, since the content of the lecture was not big and deep, I have been directly researching focusing on Reinforcement Learning after graduation, and now it seems that I have achieved the Tensorflow model to the level of creation without any problems.
