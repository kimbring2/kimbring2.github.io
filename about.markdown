I am a researcher interested in making agents more like humans, mainly using Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 
Even though I know that Deep Learning allows for a large number and know that there are many different fields, the blog will mainly raise Reinforcment Learning.

Since there was a limit to learning alone, I was proceeding with Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree course and was able to graduate safely. This lecture was the best lecture I had heard, so I am very excited that I have completed the whole process.

However, since the content of the lecture was not big and deep, I have been directly researching focusing on Reinforcement Learning after graduation, and now it seems that I have achieved the Tensorflow model to the level of creation without any problems.
